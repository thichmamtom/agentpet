Run several coding agents at once (Claude Code, Codex, ...) and AgentPet tells you, at a glance, which one is **working**, which one is **done**, and which one is **waiting for your input**, so you stop tab-hunting across terminals. A little pet floats on your desktop and reacts to it all.

## Why

Running multiple agents in parallel means constantly switching windows to check who needs you. AgentPet surfaces that in two places:

- **Menu bar monitor** for the details: every running agent, its state, what it's doing, and a live timer.
- **Desktop pet** for an ambient signal you can read without breaking focus.

## Features

- **Multi-agent monitor** in the menu bar: live list of every agent with a colored status dot, the project, what it's doing (running tool / waiting reason), and a per-state timer that counts in real time.
- **At-a-glance menu bar icon**: shows the number of running agents, and turns **orange with a count** when one needs your input.
- **Desktop pet** that reacts to the aggregate state (working / waiting / done / celebrate), with an optional **chat bubble** (built-in or fully custom messages).
- **Native notifications** when an agent finishes or needs input.
- **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, opencode, Windsurf & Antigravity** integration via hooks, with one-tap install from Settings (precise working / waiting / done / idle, including "needs your input"). GLM (Z.AI) works through Claude Code automatically. Cursor, Windsurf and Antigravity report working/done (they have no "needs input" hook).
- **Universal wrapper** `agentpet run -- <command>` to monitor *any* CLI agent (working/done), no per-agent setup.
- **Pet system**: browse an online pet library and download with one click, map each animation to a state, resize, and customise chat lines.
- **Polished, native Settings** (tabbed, dark) that never steals focus.

## Requirements

- **macOS 13 Ventura or later** (macOS 14 Sonoma+ recommended; the keyboard-focus-ring cleanup uses APIs available on macOS 14+).
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and Intel Macs** are both supported.
- macOS only, by design. There is no Windows or Linux version.
- To build from source: Xcode 16 / Swift 6.

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask ntd4996/tap/agentpet
```

### Direct download

Grab the latest `AgentPet.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/ntd4996/agentpet/releases), open it, and drag AgentPet to Applications.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntd4996/agentpet.git
cd agentpet
./scripts/build-app.sh release
open build/AgentPet.app
```

Builds are Developer ID-signed and notarized by Apple, so they open without a Gatekeeper warning. AgentPet also updates itself: it checks for new versions automatically, and you can update in-app from the menu bar **Updates** button.

On first launch, open **Settings → General** and click **Install** next to Claude Code, then **Enable** notifications.

### Uninstall

1. In **Settings → General**, click **Remove** next to each agent you connected (this strips AgentPet's hooks from the agents' config so they don't error after the app is gone).
2. Remove the app and its data:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask agentpet          # or drag /Applications/AgentPet.app to Trash
rm -rf ~/.agentpet                       # downloaded pets + state
rm -f  ~/Library/Preferences/com.agentpet.app.plist
```

## Usage

**Claude Code** (recommended): install the hook from Settings. AgentPet then reflects each session's real state (including "waiting for input").

**Any other CLI agent**: wrap it.

```bash
agentpet run -- <your-agent-command>     # e.g. agentpet run -- aider
```

The session shows as *working* while it runs and *done* when it exits.

## Pets

Pets use the open Codex pet-pack format (`pet.json` + an 8×9 spritesheet). You can:

- **Browse** the online library and download a pet with one click (Settings → Pet → Browse pets).
- **Map animations**: pick which sheet animation plays for each state.
- **Delete** pets you no longer want.

A starter pet is installed automatically on first launch. AgentPet bundles no pet art; packs are added at runtime.

## Roadmap

- Notarized DMG + Homebrew cask
- Click an agent to reveal its terminal
- Per-project pets

## Community ports

AgentPet is macOS-only, but the community has reimagined it for other platforms:

- **Linux (Rust + GTK4)** , [agentpet-linux](https://github.com/tranhuuhuy297/agentpet-linux) by [@tranhuuhuy297](https://github.com/tranhuuhuy297). An independent, from-scratch port for Ubuntu (Claude Code + Codex).

These are separate community projects, not maintained here. Building one? Open an issue and we'll link it.

## Tech

Swift + SwiftUI, a Unix-socket daemon for agent events, and a tiny CLI helper, all in one SwiftPM package. See [`docs/specs`](docs/specs) for the design.

## Support
